## Summary

A sliding lid box with a captive lid. Designed for actual printing with parameter for making sure lid slides in cleanly.You can set wall, lid, and floor thickness independently. Orientation for printing option.Fingernail grip recess for easy openeingRecessed central label pane is optional.can preview partially opened to see what you're getting.

## Updated

There is an Option to attach a height and lenght modifiable extra box to the back creating an extra lid as well.
The dividers can be set to be either even (and only in the Primary box) or with custom distances which will be able to go into the extra box and change height accordingly (on the Y-Dividers only).

## For coders

Something that could be added is X-Dividers also changing height and make them go into the extra box and possibly a function to cut the box and lid in half to accomodate smaller Printers so cutting doesn´t need to be done on the printer Software.
