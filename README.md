# Purpose
The purpose of the project was to create a dominoes game that can be played well by everybody regardless of visual impairment.
To achieve this we created Dominoe pieces that are easier to handle and can be identified well by touch, stands that can be used to clip in the Dominoe pieces and an attachable board which makes it possible to affix the played pieces firmly so they won't be accidently moved.

# Contents
This repository contains the files required to 3d print a Dominoes set, stands, the attachable board and the box to store everything.

# Printing and Costs

Use a 3d Printing software of your choice. The .stl files should be compatible with most. If you want to customize the box [openscad](https://openscad.org/) is the open source software required to modify and export the .scad files, otherwise 2 presets have already been exported as .stl files.
For the printing itself, only filament is needed. We used PLA and ABS filament. The cost depends on where you buy it, but it usually ranges from 13€ to 28€.
